# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added
- added native Prime Agent package support with Prime config discovery, project-safe overrides, archive exclusions, host-neutral session handling, and install/validation guidance
- added a complete Prime-shaped extension contract fixture plus self-contained compile/behavior/static gates and an installed-Prime declaration check for the 0.7.2 baseline

### Changed
- centralized legacy pi and Prime Agent lifecycle, input-delivery, prompt-discovery, status-rendering, and command-output differences in the Oracle host adapter while preserving existing pi behavior

### Fixed
- made daemon/headless command output visible through Prime's session-result envelope instead of UI-only notifications
- made status rendering tolerate Prime Agent UI availability before theme initialization
- snapshot host state before async startup work and invalidate stale lifecycle callbacks after shutdown or reload

### Validation
- compile the full extension against both the project pi types and the Prime compatibility contract; exercise host behavior and static compatibility invariants before merge

## 0.7.20 - 2026-07-28

### Fixed
- accepted undifferentiated ChatGPT Pro compact menus (bare Pro / Instant 5.5) so pro presets can configure without Standard/Extended rows
- replaced `\S` tool-schema non-blank patterns with a GBNF-safe character class so llama.cpp-backed OpenAI-compatible servers can compile oracle tool schemas

### Validation
- ran the full `npm run release:check` local gate before release

## 0.7.19 - 2026-07-16

### Changed
- refreshed the local Pi/pi-ai development lock, sanity contracts, safe-loader version check, and compatibility guidance for Pi 0.80.9; Oracle does not use the removed SDK auth/session options

## 0.7.18 - 2026-07-14

### Changed
- refreshed the local Pi/pi-ai development lock, sanity contracts, safe-loader version check, and compatibility guidance for Pi 0.80.7
- updated the local Pi and pi-ai development baseline to 0.80.6
- switched provider and mode tool schemas to Pi's Google-compatible `StringEnum` helper

### Fixed
- made the sanity harness independent of the caller's browser profile layout and installed `agent-browser` sessions

## 0.7.17 - 2026-07-01

### Changed
- clarified oracle prompt/docs validation around provider upload ceilings, Node release-gate requirements, and follow-up dispatch rules
- centralized provider normalization, project-trust probing, oracle jobs-dir defaults, and timestamp parsing in narrow source-of-truth modules

### Fixed
- made sanity-runner mode and real-smoke timeout validation fail through tested behavior paths instead of brittle source-string contracts
- removed duplicate worker/auth helper logic for snapshot parsing, URL normalization, conversation ids, and login-probe normalization

### Validation
- ran the full `npm run verify:oracle` local gate before release

## 0.7.16 - 2026-06-24

### Changed
- updated the local pi development and validation baseline to `@earendil-works/*` `0.80.2`
- exposed packaged `/oracle` and `/oracle-followup` prompt templates through the package manifest so TUI slash completion can discover them
- reduced always-on `oracle_submit` prompt metadata while keeping detailed dispatch rules in the prompt templates

### Fixed
- made `/oracle-*` command output visible in JSON mode through a displayed custom message instead of UI notifications only
- deferred Chrome user-agent probing until oracle config is loaded, with a timeout on the Chrome version probe

## 0.7.15 - 2026-06-23

### Changed
- updated the local pi development and validation baseline to `@earendil-works/*` `0.80.1`
- refreshed oracle README and sanity contracts for pi `0.80.1`
- moved script-only `@earendil-works/pi-ai` type imports to `@earendil-works/pi-ai/compat`, matching the Pi 0.80 source typechecking migration guidance

### Compatibility
- reviewed the pi `0.80.0` and `0.80.1` changelogs plus current extension lifecycle, project-trust, security, and package docs; no oracle runtime behavior change was required

### Validation
- ran `npm run release:check`, including `npm run verify:oracle`, fresh live ChatGPT preset proof for every canonical preset, and Crabbox macOS, Ubuntu, and Windows native `platform-build` plus `real-extension` suites

## 0.7.14 - 2026-06-22

### Changed
- updated the local pi development and validation baseline to `@earendil-works/*` `0.79.10`
- refreshed oracle docs and sanity contracts for pi `0.79.10`, and removed the obsolete fleet-tested marker

### Fixed
- used pi's exported `CONFIG_DIR_NAME` for project config and workspace-root detection instead of hardcoding `.pi`
- clarified `oracle_preflight` path labels so isolated-session probes distinguish the current persisted session from the provider auth seed profile
- fixed ChatGPT response completion detection for the current DOM, where assistant text uses `data-message-author-role="assistant"` without legacy `.message-bubble` nodes

### Compatibility
- reviewed the pi `0.79.10` changelog, extension lifecycle docs/types, compaction event docs, project-trust docs, and package/update docs; no oracle compaction hook changes were required

### Validation
- ran `npm run verify:oracle`, `npm run smoke:real:packed`, source-mode isolated pi model-agent smoke with the `instant` preset, and `npm run smoke:platform:all`

## 0.7.13 - 2026-06-15

### Added
- added a release-blocking ChatGPT preset proof gate (`npm run release:proof:chatgpt-presets`) so publishing requires fresh loaded-extension evidence for every canonical ChatGPT preset

### Fixed
- fixed compact ChatGPT Intelligence menu handling so selected thinking tiers that close back to `Medium`, `High`, or `Extra High` composer pills are accepted only after an intentional matching menu click instead of falling through to the removed legacy effort dropdown
- fixed `instant_auto_switch` under the compact ChatGPT UI, where the legacy auto-switch control is absent after selecting the compact `Instant` tier
- made ChatGPT model-configuration opening tolerate slower compact-UI hydration before reporting UI drift
- stabilized archive creation when the compression subprocess exits before tar, so the worker terminates upstream tar immediately instead of waiting for the archive timeout
- surfaced provider rate-limit/outage modals explicitly during ChatGPT model setup, upload, send, and response waits instead of reporting generic UI drift

## 0.7.12 - 2026-06-15

### Changed
- switched Grok oracle submissions to gzip-compressed tar archives (`.tar.gz`) so Grok can extract uploaded context without `zstd`
- centralized provider archive policy for archive format, upload ceiling, and local compression prerequisites
- split oracle archive construction out of the agent-facing tool orchestration module

### Fixed
- preserved ChatGPT `.tar.zst` submissions and `zstd` preflight requirements when ChatGPT is explicitly selected while Grok is the configured default provider

### Validation
- ran the full `npm run verify:oracle` release gate
- verified isolated local `pi` submissions create extractable Grok `.tar.gz` and explicit ChatGPT `.tar.zst` archives

## 0.7.11 - 2026-06-15

### Changed
- updated the local pi development and validation baseline to `@earendil-works/*` `0.79.4`
- refreshed oracle docs and sanity-check baselines for pi `0.79.4`

### Validation
- ran the full `npm run verify:oracle` release gate under pi `0.79.4`

## 0.7.10 - 2026-06-13

### Added
- added explicit existing ChatGPT browser-thread targeting for `/oracle`, `oracle_preflight`, and `oracle_submit` through optional `chatGptConversationId`, accepting raw ChatGPT conversation ids or full `https://chatgpt.com/c/...` / `https://chat.openai.com/c/...` URLs while preserving fresh-thread defaults when omitted

### Validation
- verified existing-thread preflight and submit flows in isolated `pi` sessions, including persisted `chatUrl` / `conversationId` job metadata with a fake worker
- ran the full `npm run verify:oracle` release gate

## 0.7.9 - 2026-06-11

### Fixed
- made oracle workers launch their isolated Chrome runtime directly and attach `agent-browser` via DevTools, avoiding failures when unrelated `agent-browser` sessions or daemons are already running
- tightened worker-owned browser cleanup so runtime profiles are deleted only after the isolated Chrome process has been closed or terminated
- rejected `browser.args` overrides that would bypass oracle-managed Chrome profile or DevTools isolation

### Validation
- verified ChatGPT and Grok oracle smoke tests against the local source extension after the worker-owned browser launch fix

## 0.7.8 - 2026-06-11

### Changed
- updated the local pi development baseline to `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` / `@earendil-works/pi-ai` `0.79.1` and regenerated the npm lockfile
- documented `pi` `0.79.1+` as the suggested tested floor while keeping pi runtime packages as optional wildcard peers so npm peer ranges do not block users from trying newer pi releases
- updated isolated local-extension and packed package validation workflows to pass explicit `--approve` when they intentionally trust their temporary project fixtures under Pi 0.79.1 project-trust rules
- made TUI `/oracle` and `/oracle-followup` commands reappear as compact user messages for prompt-history/up-arrow recall while keeping verbose dispatch instructions hidden

### Fixed
- made project-local `.pi/extensions/oracle.json` overrides honor Pi's effective project trust decision (`ctx.isProjectTrusted()`), including `--no-approve` and saved “do not trust” decisions while preserving the historical default of loading safe project overrides for existing oracle users
- updated ChatGPT model-selection handling for the current compact selector labels, including `Extra High`, `Pro Standard`, and `Pro Extended`
- hardened ChatGPT/Grok send handling so oracle workers require provider acceptance evidence before entering `awaiting_response`, preventing unsent composer drafts from masquerading as running jobs
- dismissed ChatGPT Pro feedback dialogs during model configuration instead of mistaking their generic `Close` control for configuration UI

### Compatibility
- reviewed the pi `0.79.1` changelog, project-trust docs, extension docs, package docs, prompt-template docs, SDK/RPC exports, and matching examples; the oracle extension remains compatible with current extension lifecycle and package install/update behavior

## 0.7.7 - 2026-06-08

### Changed
- updated the local pi development baseline to `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` / `@earendil-works/pi-ai` `0.79.0` and regenerated the npm lockfile
- documented `pi` `0.79.0+` as the suggested tested floor while keeping pi runtime packages as optional wildcard peers so npm peer ranges do not block users from trying newer pi releases
- updated isolated local-extension and packed package validation workflows to pass explicit `--approve` when they intentionally trust their temporary project fixtures under Pi 0.79.0 project-trust rules

### Fixed
- made project-local `.pi/extensions/oracle.json` overrides honor explicit Pi project-trust opt-outs (`--no-approve` or a saved “do not trust” decision) while preserving the historical default of loading safe project overrides for existing oracle users

### Compatibility
- reviewed the pi `0.79.0` changelog, project-trust docs, extension docs, package docs, prompt-template docs, SDK/RPC exports, and matching examples; the oracle extension remains compatible with current extension lifecycle and package install/update behavior

## 0.7.6 - 2026-06-04

### Changed
- updated the local pi development baseline to `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` / `@earendil-works/pi-ai` `0.78.1` and regenerated the npm lockfile
- documented `pi` `0.78.1+` as the suggested tested floor while keeping pi runtime packages as optional wildcard peers so newer pi releases are not blocked by npm peer ranges
- added Ant Ling, NVIDIA NIM, and MiniMax China provider env mappings to the oracle real-smoke/platform-smoke provider metadata

### Fixed
- made startup poller and wake-up routing mode-aware with Pi 0.78.1 `ctx.mode`, so print and JSON one-shot runs do not start background pollers or publish oracle UI status
- guarded oracle startup status and warning notifications with `ctx.hasUI` for non-UI modes

### Compatibility
- reviewed the pi `0.78.1` changelog, extension docs, package docs, prompt-template docs, and matching examples; the oracle extension remains compatible with current extension lifecycle and package install/update behavior

## 0.7.5 - 2026-06-02

### Added
- added a Crabbox platform release smoke gate for macOS, Ubuntu, and Windows native with doctor-first validation, packed-install real-extension proof, stop evidence, and platform artifacts
- added canonical workflow docs and scripts for everyday local validation, focused platform-sensitive runs, and full release/publish smoke coverage

### Changed
- made the default packed real smoke deterministic by installing the packed package into a clean pi project and invoking the installed `oracle_submit` tool path without waiting on a model-agent turn
- made Windows native a supported package OS and moved reusable Windows smoke dependencies into the Parallels template/snapshot workflow

### Fixed
- hardened Windows archive/process/profile handling, including taskkill cleanup, executable resolution, tar/zstd archive behavior, path safety, and auth-bootstrap absolute-path checks
- removed production `as unknown as` casts and switched Linux/Windows runtime profile copies to Node recursive copy instead of relying on POSIX `cp`

### Validation
- verified `npm run verify:oracle`, `git diff --check`, and `npm run smoke:platform:all` across macOS, Ubuntu, and Windows native before release

## 0.7.4 - 2026-05-28

### Changed
- updated the local pi development baseline to `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` / `@earendil-works/pi-ai` `0.77.0` and regenerated the npm lockfile
- kept pi runtime packages as optional wildcard peers and removed the Node.js engine upper bound so future pi releases are not blocked at install time

### Compatibility
- reviewed the pi `0.77.0` changelog and package guidance; the oracle extension remains compatible with current extension lifecycle and package install/update behavior

## 0.7.3 - 2026-05-27

### Changed
- updated the local pi development baseline to `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` / `@earendil-works/pi-ai` `0.76.0` and regenerated the npm lockfile
- aligned `engines.node` to `>=22.19.0 <25` with the pi `0.76.0` Node.js floor and the supported Node 22–24 range

### Compatibility
- reviewed the pi `0.76.0` changelog and package guidance; the oracle extension remains compatible with current extension lifecycle and package install/update behavior

## 0.7.2 - 2026-05-23

### Changed
- updated the local pi development baseline to `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` / `@earendil-works/pi-ai` `0.75.5`, refreshed Node/tsx tooling, and regenerated the npm lockfile
- updated `@steipete/sweet-cookie` to `0.3.0` for the current browser-cookie extraction baseline
- refreshed the `protobufjs` override to `7.6.1` for the current patched dependency graph

### Compatibility
- reviewed the pi `0.75.5` changelog and package guidance; the oracle extension remains compatible with current extension lifecycle and package install/update behavior

## 0.7.1 - 2026-05-18

### Changed
- updated the local pi development baseline to `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` `0.75.3` and refreshed the npm lockfile
- raised the local Node.js tooling floor and sanity checks to `>=22.19.0`
- refreshed the `protobufjs` override to `7.5.6` for the current patched dependency graph
- removed tracked CueLoop runtime state from the repository and ignored local `.cueloop/` artifacts

### Compatibility
- reviewed current pi `0.75.3` package and extension guidance and confirmed the oracle extension remains compatible with current extension lifecycle and package install/update guidance


## 0.7.0 - 2026-05-17

### Added
- added Grok Heavy as a second oracle provider, with `provider: "grok"`, Grok-only `mode: "heavy"`, `/oracle-auth grok`, separate Grok auth seed profiles, and provider defaults in oracle config
- added provider-aware `oracle_preflight` support, including explicit Grok checks and follow-up readiness checks that use the prior job's provider
- added Grok web worker support for auth readiness, Heavy selection, archive upload, prompt submission, response extraction, and same-thread follow-ups

### Changed
- documented provider selection, Grok's 200 MiB upload ceiling, ChatGPT's 250 MiB ceiling, and same-provider-only follow-up behavior in README, design docs, and prompt templates
- updated oracle job summaries to report Grok provider/mode selections, not only ChatGPT presets

### Fixed
- preserved Cloudflare continuity cookies for current ChatGPT verification flows and removed Chromium singleton artifacts when cloning runtime profiles
- tightened Grok/X cookie import to an explicit auth-cookie allowlist and made Grok jobs fail clearly if a completed response never produces a stable conversation URL
- improved ChatGPT response extraction fallback behavior when the UI no longer exposes the old `ChatGPT said:` heading structure

### Validation
- verified Grok Heavy live submission and same-thread Grok follow-up using isolated local-extension `pi` sessions
- verified a final ChatGPT `instant` live smoke using an isolated local-extension `pi` session before release

## 0.6.17 - 2026-05-10

### Changed
- made `/oracle-auth` success and failure output easier to scan, with compact source summaries and source-specific troubleshooting for configured Chromium cookie sources
- expanded package support to Linux, using ordinary profile copies off macOS and documenting `@steipete/sweet-cookie`'s Linux keyring/password options for Chromium cookie import
- tightened README quickstart/command wording around preflight-first `/oracle` behavior, context-rich archive selection, cleanup retention, and preset defaults
- added the resolved oracle model preset snapshot to `oracle_submit` queued/dispatched output so agents can see what preset will run
- clarified `oracle_preflight` output so users can see that it validates the persisted pi session, local config, and ChatGPT auth seed created by `oracle_auth`
- made direct `scripts/oracle-sanity.ts` execution fail fast unless isolated oracle state/jobs dirs are provided, preventing accidental sanity-job leakage into live oracle pollers

### Fixed
- stopped worker/auth readiness checks from treating ChatGPT's public logged-out composer shell as an authenticated ready state, and made stale-auth failures name the visible login controls instead of reporting a misleading partial-login state
- made plain `instant` model selection robust against the current ChatGPT model menu by recognizing closed Instant chips and falling back to the top-level model menu when the configure sheet is unavailable

## 0.6.16 - 2026-05-07

### Changed
- migrated the local pi development baseline and peer metadata from deprecated `@mariozechner/*` packages to maintained `@earendil-works/*` `0.74.0`
- regenerated the npm lockfile against the current stable dependency graph and refreshed the `basic-ftp` override to the current patched major

### Compatibility
- reviewed the pi `0.74.0` changelog and confirmed the oracle extension remains compatible with current extension lifecycle and package install/update guidance

## 0.6.15 - 2026-05-03

### Fixed
- anchored the `oracle_submit.files[]` schema pattern so OpenAI-compatible parsers that require anchored JSON Schema regexes, including llama.cpp, can load the oracle tools
- made background poller queued-job promotion best-effort under normal global admission-lock contention, avoiding noisy scan failures when multiple pi sessions are live
- added configured Chromium-family cookie source support for `/oracle-auth`, including macOS Keychain decryption for browser cookie stores not handled by `@steipete/sweet-cookie`

## 0.6.14 - 2026-05-02

### Fixed
- deduped oracle completion wake-ups by marking one-time best-effort delivery in job state before the poller sends the follow-up turn, preventing repeated identical completion notifications across poller scans
- clarified completion wake-up guidance so agents treat the wake-up as a read/inspect prompt rather than an automatic auth refresh or resubmission instruction

### Changed
- `oracle_read` and `/oracle-status` summaries for active jobs now include elapsed time, phase elapsed time, and a poll/backoff hint so manual checks waste fewer turns
- `oracle_submit` preset schema and prompt guidance now list the canonical preset ids directly for tool callers

## 0.6.13 - 2026-05-01

### Changed
- updated the local pi development baseline to `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent` `0.72.0` and refreshed the TypeBox development dependency graph
- regenerated the npm lockfile against the current stable dependency graph
- aligned pi core peer metadata with current pi package guidance

### Compatibility
- reviewed the pi `0.72.0` changelog and confirmed the oracle extension does not define provider `compat.reasoningEffortMap` metadata and remains compatible with current extension lifecycle and package install/update guidance


## 0.6.12 - 2026-05-01

### Changed
- updated the local pi development baseline to `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent` `0.71.1` and refreshed the TypeBox development dependency
- regenerated the npm lockfile against the current stable dependency graph

### Compatibility
- reviewed the pi `0.71.1` changelog and confirmed the oracle extension remains compatible with current extension lifecycle, package install/update, and TypeBox 1.x guidance


## 0.6.11 - 2026-04-30

### Fixed
- updated ChatGPT auth/readiness detection and model preset selection for the current ChatGPT UI, including bare effort chips like `Light` and current `Model` controls
- restored generated artifact capture for ChatGPT's current `Download the file` behavior buttons by associating response-local filenames with generic download controls and following the JSON `download_url` indirection to the final file bytes
- reduced false-positive artifact reporting from response text labels that look like filenames but do not have a confirmed downloadable control

### Validation
- verified live `instant`, `thinking_light`, `instant_auto_switch`, `pro_standard`, follow-up, and isolated local-extension oracle runs against the changed ChatGPT UI
- verified byte-correct generated artifact downloads in both live and isolated local-extension runs

## 0.6.10 - 2026-04-23

### Changed
- updated the local pi development baseline to `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent` `0.70.0`
- regenerated the npm lockfile against the current stable dependency graph

### Compatibility
- reviewed the pi `0.70.0` changelog and confirmed the oracle extension does not depend on the changed terminal progress defaults or the new `--no-builtin-tools` behavior

## 0.6.9 - 2026-04-23

### Changed
- updated the local pi development baseline to `@mariozechner/pi-ai` / `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent` `0.69.0`
- migrated published TypeBox integration metadata and source imports from `@sinclair/typebox` to `typebox` for pi `0.69.0` compatibility
- updated the local oracle verification flow to externalize `typebox` in the extension bundle check and regenerated the npm lockfile against the current stable dependency graph

### Fixed
- stopped background poller scans from touching stale pi extension contexts after session replacement or reload
- avoided consuming wake-up retry attempts when a stopped poller exits before sending its best-effort reminder

### Compatibility
- reviewed the pi `0.69.0` changelog and confirmed the extension already uses explicit session-scoped objects in the relevant flows while now matching the required TypeBox 1.x package name


## 0.6.8 - 2026-04-21

### Changed
- updated the local pi development baseline to `@mariozechner/pi-ai` / `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent` `0.68.0`
- regenerated the npm lockfile against the current stable dependency graph

### Compatibility
- reviewed the pi `0.68.0` changelog and confirmed the extension already uses explicit session cwd values instead of relying on removed ambient cwd fallbacks in public helpers

## 0.6.7 - 2026-04-18

### Changed
- bumped the local pi development baseline to `@mariozechner/pi-ai` / `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent` `0.67.68` and `typescript` `6.0.3`
- refreshed the release lockfile against the current stable pi patch line

### Fixed
- pinned the transitive `basic-ftp` dependency to `5.3.0` and `protobufjs` to `7.5.5` to clear the current audit findings without introducing peer conflicts
- updated the release sanity guard to enforce the patched override versions during future publishes

## 0.6.6 - 2026-04-16

### Changed
- updated the local pi development baseline to `@mariozechner/pi-ai` / `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent` `0.67.4`
- aligned `packageManager` metadata to `npm@10.9.8`, the latest stable npm line compatible with the declared Node runtime floor
- removed the published `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent` peer dependency so installs rely on pi's bundled runtime instead of npm peer-resolution churn

## 0.6.5 - 2026-04-15

### Changed
- pinned `packageManager` metadata to `npm@11.12.1` and refreshed the release lockfile against the current stable pi toolchain so `verify:oracle` resolves reproducibly across machines
- kept the published oracle runtime surface unchanged while moving local development dependencies to the current stable pi/TypeScript/Node typing baseline

## 0.6.4 - 2026-04-14

### Changed
- bumped the local development and release toolchain to the latest published pi packages and current TypeScript/esbuild/Node type definitions so release verification now runs against the same pi generation shipping on this machine

### Fixed
- `oracle_submit` archive creation now handles downstream `zstd` pipe failures as normal tool errors instead of crashing the host `pi` process with an unhandled `write EPIPE` on newer Node runtimes
- sanity coverage now exercises the broken-pipe archive path so early downstream compressor exits regress to a clean rejection instead of a process-level crash

## 0.6.3 - 2026-04-13

### Fixed
- workspace-root detection now prefers nearest project markers like `.pi/` and `AGENTS.md` over unrelated ancestor git roots, so oracle submissions from nested projects no longer widen to a home-directory repo and reject valid project-relative archive inputs like `AGENTS.md`
- sanity coverage now guards the nested-project-under-ancestor-git case so archive resolution stays anchored to the intended project root

## 0.6.2 - 2026-04-13

### Changed
- `/oracle` and `/oracle-followup` now treat pre-dispatch `archive_too_large` submit failures as retryable archive-selection misses instead of immediate dead ends, so agents can automatically narrow the archive and retry before surfacing the problem to the user

### Fixed
- archive-too-large submit errors now explain the 250 MB limit in human-readable terms, state that dispatch stopped before launch, and describe an ordered retry plan for shrinking the archive
- oracle tool guidance, docs, and sanity coverage now align on only ending the turn after successful/queued `oracle_submit` results instead of accidentally stopping on a retryable oversize failure

## 0.6.1 - 2026-04-13

### Fixed
- whole-repo archive expansion now merges very large entry groups iteratively instead of using spread/flat patterns that can overflow the JavaScript call stack during `oracle_submit`
- oracle sanity coverage now guards the large-entry merge path so broad archive submissions regress to a real archive/env error instead of `Maximum call stack size exceeded`

## 0.6.0 - 2026-04-13

### Added
- `oracle_auth`, an agent-facing tool that mirrors `/oracle-auth` so oracle runs can refresh the shared ChatGPT auth seed profile before a single retry when stale auth blocks execution

### Changed
- `/oracle` and `/oracle-followup` now follow a stricter preflight-first flow, bias toward context-rich archive selection up to the 250 MB ceiling, and explicitly allow one `oracle_auth` refresh before retrying stale-auth/login-required failures
- package metadata now follows the current pi package dependency guidance by publishing `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent` and `@sinclair/typebox` as peer dependencies while keeping local typechecking/dev resolution intact

### Fixed
- `/oracle` no-session and missing-seed flows now stop before unnecessary repo exploration, and prompt-template guidance keeps relevant surrounding archive context instead of over-optimizing for minimal slices when extra context still fits
- oracle model selection now recognizes ChatGPT family controls exposed as radios/menu items plus durable closed-chip states like `Extended thinking` and `Extended Pro`, so remembered new-chat defaults no longer derail preset configuration or ready-state detection
- authenticated ready-state detection now accepts extended closed-chip model controls during auth/bootstrap verification, preventing false login/setup failures when ChatGPT remembers a non-default preset

## 0.5.0 - 2026-04-12

### Added
- `oracle_preflight`, a lightweight readiness tool that lets `/oracle` fail fast on missing persisted-session or local auth/config blockers before archive/context work begins

### Changed
- `/oracle` now follows a stricter preflight-first flow, biases toward minimal context gathering for explicitly narrow requests, and prefers the configured default model unless a different preset is clearly needed
- `oracle_read`, `/oracle-status`, and wake-up messaging now keep the true terminal event prominent, separate wake-up bookkeeping from failure state, and stop implying that a missing `response.md` is ready
- `/oracle-auth` failure guidance now reports the effective agent config path for the active agent dir and explains when a project config was also read but could not override `auth.*`
- `/oracle-clean` now documents the short post-send retention grace window and returns a retry-after timestamp when a terminal job is still intentionally retained

### Fixed
- `oracle_submit` now rejects locally knowable auth-seed blockers before archive creation or job persistence while still preserving direct archive-input validation errors like symlink escapes
- oracle tool results now use consistent structured `details.job` / `details.error` payloads and preserve `isError` for structured failures through the tool-result hook
- `/oracle` no-session and missing-seed flows now stop before unnecessary repo exploration, and narrow prompt-template runs dispatch more quickly with smaller archives when the user scope is explicit
- repeated oracle sanity runs now quiesce background pollers before isolated-state teardown so release verification no longer emits a noisy temp-lock ENOENT race

## 0.4.0 - 2026-04-12

### Added
- repeatable isolated local-extension `pi` validation guidance for oracle release verification, including smoke workflows that load the in-repo extension source directly
- persisted oracle lifecycle-event breadcrumbs plus richer detached-job observability in `oracle_submit`, `oracle_read`, poller wake-ups, and `/oracle-status`, including worker-log paths and last-event context
- shared worker/auth validation helpers, shared concurrency primitives, shared lifecycle reducers, and shared observability formatters to keep extension and worker behavior aligned
- extracted sanity-harness support and poller suites with typed helper scaffolding and repeated-run stability coverage

### Changed
- oracle whole-repo archiving now excludes local tool state like `.pi/`, `.oracle-context/`, `.cursor/`, and `.scratchpad.md` by default while preserving explicitly requested paths
- lock/lease recovery, queue promotion, process identity handling, and lifecycle transitions now flow through shared helper modules instead of duplicated inline implementations
- worker/auth verification now leans on behaviorally tested helper modules plus dedicated `typecheck:worker-helpers` coverage instead of syntax checks and brittle source-string assertions alone
- release validation now expects isolated local-extension `pi` smoke tests and a stronger local oracle verification gate before shipping

### Fixed
- archive input resolution now rejects symlink escapes outside the repo root and preserves safer repo-boundary handling for targeted archives
- hung `tar`, `zstd`, `cp`, and auth `agent-browser` subprocesses now time out and fail clearly instead of wedging archive, runtime-clone, or auth flows indefinitely
- cleanup warnings without a live worker no longer consume runtime/conversation capacity forever, while teardown still attempts lease release and preserves warnings for later triage
- detached oracle workers and poller flows now report clearer lifecycle breadcrumbs, wake-up settlement state, and failure context during fast-fail auth/bootstrap scenarios
- sanity-runner cleanup now retries transient temp-directory removal races, and the extracted harness is less timing-fragile and less `any`-driven than the previous monolithic runner

## 0.3.4 - 2026-04-11

### Changed
- oracle archive defaults now exclude nested `secrets/` and `.secrets/` directories anywhere in the repo unless they are explicitly requested
- package metadata now reflects the current runtime floor and platform support (`node >=22`, `darwin`) and local release automation runs `verify:oracle` through `npm test` / `prepublishOnly`

### Fixed
- model verification now distinguishes `thinking`, `pro`, `instant`, and `instant_auto_switch` more conservatively instead of accepting mismatched presets on partial UI evidence
- artifact-only assistant responses can now complete without timing out on missing plain-text bodies
- `/oracle-auth` diagnostics now write into a unique private temp directory per run instead of fixed `/tmp/oracle-auth.*` paths
- sanity coverage now exercises shared ChatGPT UI helpers directly, verifies nested secret exclusion, and guards the new auth diagnostics path handling

## 0.3.3 - 2026-04-11

### Added
- `oracle_submit` now accepts canonical preset ids plus matching human-readable preset labels/common hyphen-space variants and normalizes them back to the canonical preset id at submit time
- lock sweeping now gives in-flight `.tmp-*` lock/state directories a dedicated grace window so concurrent sweep does not delete another process's atomic publish

### Changed
- oracle submit metadata/docs now point preset discovery at the canonical registry/README while keeping execute-time normalization for flexible caller input

### Fixed
- closed a concurrent stale-lock sweep race that could reclaim another process's in-flight lock publish before metadata landed
- oracle sanity coverage now verifies preset alias validation/normalization and the `.tmp-*` grace window behavior end-to-end

## 0.3.2 - 2026-04-08

### Changed
- README now lists the available oracle preset ids directly, so users can choose `defaults.preset` values without having to inspect source files

### Fixed
- closed a README usability gap where preset-based configuration was documented without actually enumerating the shipped preset ids
- oracle sanity coverage now verifies that the README lists every preset from the canonical `ORACLE_SUBMIT_PRESETS` registry

## 0.3.1 - 2026-04-08

### Changed
- rewrote the GitHub-facing README to work better as a landing page, with a sharper value prop, clearer install guidance, a real quickstart, example requests, a minimal config example, troubleshooting, and a high-level flow diagram
- README now explains when to use `pi-oracle`, when not to use it first, where outputs live, and what to do if a wake-up is missed

### Fixed
- removed the stale legacy model wording from the README example flow and aligned user-facing setup docs with the preset-based configuration model

## 0.3.0 - 2026-04-08

### Changed
- breaking: `oracle_submit` and oracle config defaults now use preset-only model selection; legacy `modelFamily` / `effort` / `autoSwitchToThinking` submit inputs and default config fields were removed in favor of canonical preset ids
- oracle jobs now persist a resolved `selection` snapshot and the worker configures ChatGPT from that persisted selection instead of re-deriving model settings from legacy job fields
- oracle model preset definitions now come from a single canonical registry in `extensions/oracle/lib/config.ts`

### Fixed
- removed duplicate hand-maintained preset-id examples from agent-facing prompt and design docs so callers are directed to the tool schema / canonical registry instead of stale inline lists
- oracle sanity coverage now validates the preset-only contract from the registered tool schema and canonical registry instead of brittle prose-only assertions
- worker model configuration now consistently uses the explicit `configureModel(job)` parameter instead of hidden coupling through the module-global current job

## 0.2.2 - 2026-04-07

### Fixed
- missed ChatGPT file artifacts now map generic download controls onto nearby filenames and download from live DOM selectors instead of relying only on filename-labeled snapshot refs
- oracle jobs no longer report a false-clean completion when response-local artifact signals are present but capture fails or remains inconclusive
- artifact label extraction now collapses paths and mixed response text down to real filenames so suspicious artifact fallback logic does not emit bogus labels

### Added
- regression coverage for artifact label extraction edge cases and ambiguous download-control artifact detection

## 0.2.1 - 2026-04-07

### Fixed
- wake-up guidance now tells receivers to use `oracle_read(jobId)` as the canonical way to consume completion results
- manual inspection before the first wake-up no longer suppresses the initial reminder attempt
- wake-up settlement now records provenance so suppressed/settled delivery can be explained in postmortems
- queued archive cleanup retries now retry queued archive deletion and keep warnings until cleanup succeeds
- queued archive byte-pressure accounting now includes retained pre-submit archives instead of only currently queued jobs

## 0.2.0 - 2026-04-06

### Added
- workerless queued oracle jobs with automatic promotion when capacity is available
- queue position/status reporting and queued-job cancellation
- durable wake-up target leasing for cross-process completion notification routing
- oracle now requires a persisted pi session identity instead of collapsing in-memory/no-session contexts onto a shared project-level wake-up target
- legacy project-scoped jobs from the older no-session model now stay manual/status-only on upgrade instead of being adopted by another persisted session for wake-up delivery
- lock and lease metadata publication is now atomic on both first publish and rewrites so concurrent wake-up-target reads cannot transiently hide live sessions
- metadata-less lock/lease state directories left behind by crashes are now reclaimed after a bounded grace instead of wedging future operations forever
- expanded oracle sanity coverage for queueing, recovery, cancellation, promotion, and notification edge cases
- a real TypeScript typecheck gate via `npm run typecheck` and `npm run verify:oracle`

### Changed
- queued jobs now promote using their persisted config snapshot
- runtime admission now stays blocked when cleanup warnings indicate teardown is incomplete
- cleanup-driven promotion only advances the queue after a clean runtime teardown
- orphaned completion wake-ups can be adopted safely when the original session is no longer live
- oracle completion notifications now avoid synthetic assistant session-history writes entirely and rely on durable job-state response/artifact persistence plus best-effort wake-ups

### Fixed
- PID-safe worker cancellation and stale-worker recovery paths
- same-job conversation lease reuse during queued follow-up retries
- cleanup-warning handling across submit, promotion, cancellation, and terminal cleanup flows
- queue advancement after cancellation now requires clean teardown
- cleanup failures no longer silently drop warning state or remove terminal job records prematurely
- stale notification claimants can no longer finalize completion delivery after ownership handoff
- best-effort wake-up retries remain bounded without creating synthetic completion messages in session history, including stale cross-session claimant races
- completed and cancelled jobs now prune on explicit terminal-job retention policy instead of depending on synthetic notification state
- stale live terminal cleanup workers are now terminated and recovered automatically so cleanup-pending jobs do not wedge capacity indefinitely
- prune/clean paths now coordinate with in-flight wake-up delivery so already-prunable jobs are skipped, claimed jobs are not deleted before their reminder send path resolves, and just-sent wake-ups keep their response/artifact files briefly retained
- `/oracle-clean` now refuses terminal jobs whose worker is still live instead of deleting around active cleanup
- live and off-session completion handling no longer risks corrupting active session history with extension-authored assistant appends
- `oracle_read` now reports artifact paths from the configured oracle jobs directory instead of hard-coding `/tmp`
- manual `oracle_read` and `/oracle-status` inspection now settles further wake-up retries so live sessions do not get repeated reminder turns after the job has already been opened
